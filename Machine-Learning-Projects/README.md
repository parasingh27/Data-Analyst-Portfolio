# Machine Learning Projects

This folder contains projects where I applied **machine learning techniques** to solve real-world problems. Each project demonstrates my ability to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance.

## Projects
1. **Waze User Churn Prediction**
   - **Description**: This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict user churn for Waze, a popular navigation app. The goal is to identify users who are likely to uninstall the app or stop using it.
   - **Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook.
   - **Folder**: `Waze-User-Churn-Prediction/`

2. **Salifort Motors Employee Turnover Prediction**
   - **Description**: This project focuses on analyzing employee data at Salifort Motors to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company.
   - **Tools**: Python ( Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook.
   - **Folder**: `Salifort-Motors-Employee-Turnover-Prediction/`

## How to Use This Folder
- Each project folder contains:
  - A `README.md` with detailed project information.
  - Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
  - Trained models (if applicable) and performance metrics.
- Datasets are not included due to size constraints.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Machine Learning**: Model building, evaluation, and optimization.
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.
- **Problem Solving**: Applying ML techniques to solve business problems.
